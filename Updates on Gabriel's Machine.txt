Update from July 8th, 2025

I have upgraded Python and pip from versions Python 3.6.4 and pip 9.0.3 to Python 3.9 and pip 21.3.1 .

Although it was not expected, the `submit_job_FH_Trigger.py` script still works correctly after this upgrade.

However, one change in behavior is that I now need to use:

/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --user <package>


instead of the simpler:

pip install <package>


The plain `pip install` no longer works in my environment.
