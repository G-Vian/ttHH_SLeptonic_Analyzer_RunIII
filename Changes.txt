Changes made compared to previous versions of the analyzer â€” these are important updates:

// 10/8/25 //
>Removed eventshape.cc inclusion from the header to avoid multiple definition issues.

> Moved a copy of eventshape.cc into the src directory.

> Updated the header to include only eventshape.h instead of the implementation file.

> Split the electron and muon trigger logic into separate .cc files in src for better modularity.

> Moved all cut definitions and logic into the main ttHHanalyzer.cc file for centralized handling.

> Declared the cuts variable as extern in the header to prevent redefinition during linking.
